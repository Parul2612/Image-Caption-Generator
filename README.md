# Image Caption Generator
It is a deep learning project which involves CNN and LSTM
This program is developed for recognizing the context of an image and annotating it with relevant captions using deep learning, and computer vision. It includes the labeling of an image with English keywords with the help of datasets provided during model training.

## Dataset
[FLICKR_8K](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k) This dataset includes around 1500 images along with 5 different captions written by different people for each image. The images are all contained together while caption text file has captions along with the image number appended to it. The zip file is approximately over 1 GB in size. This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.

## Requirements
- Python 3.5
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- os
- Numpy
- keras
- tensorflow

## Results
The model generates good captions for the provided image but it can always be improved.
